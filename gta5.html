                <p class="mt-2" style="text-align: justify; font-family: monospace;">Franklin Clinton is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series who appears as one of the three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, along with Michael De Santa and Trevor Philips, and as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online as part of The Contract update, also appearing as one of the two playable characters of the Short Trips mission series and the Double Down Adversary Modes, along with Lamar Davis. <br><br> Franklin was born and lived his entire life in Los Santos. He became a gangbanger at a young age and joined the Chamberlain Gangster Families alongside his best friend Lamar Davis, committing various small crimes for a living. They and their fellow CGF homies from Forum Drive would later form the independent Forum Gangsters to stay away from CGF's "retro gangster" nonsense. Franklin's story revolves around his desire to become something more and make something of himself, which he succeeds when he meets Michael, who becomes a mentor and father figure to him and recruits him in all of his robberies and various jobs for other criminals, leading to Franklin's eventual success and wealth. Franklin also befriends the third protagonist, Trevor, who, although not as close to him as Michael, still becomes a mentor to him.</p>

                <p class="mt-2" style="text-align: justify; font-family: monospace;">Michael De Santa, formerly Michael Townley, is a character appearing as one of the three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, alongside Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips. He is portrayed by Ned Luke. <br><br> Michael is a former bank robber and career criminal who faked his death to retire and live a peaceful life with his family in Los Santos. However, his unhealthy relationship with them takes its toll, and he soon gets pulled back into his criminal life, forcing him to return to his old ways. Michael's story centers around how his seemingly idyllic and halcyon lifestyle is halted as his past demons and morally dubious lifestyle choices come back to haunt him. <br><br> Meanwhile, his midlife crisis pushes him to his ultimate snapping point, and he becomes determined to achieve something more with his life while also attempting to escape his past, become a free man, and start a new life with his family. Michael is an old friend of fellow protagonist Trevor, and, early on in the storyline, he also befriends Franklin and becomes a mentor figure to him. He is the husband of Amanda and the father of Jimmy and Tracey.</p>

                <p class="mt-2" style="text-align: justify; font-family: monospace;">Trevor Philips is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series, appearing as one of the three protagonists of Grand Theft Auto V, along with Michael De Santa and Franklin Clinton, and appears as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online. He is voiced by Steven Ogg. <br><br> Trevor is a career criminal and former bank robber with a complicated past, who later founded his own company, Trevor Philips Enterprises, operating with drug dealing and weapon smuggling in Blaine County. He is friends with Ron Jakowski and Wade Hebert, who work for his company, as well as the oldest and best friend of Michael, whom he believed to be dead for almost a decade after he faked his death to retire from the criminal life. Trevor is known to have a generally reckless and very aggressive behavior, but he is also very loyal and deeply respects all those close to him. Trevor's story focuses on how his actions have consequences on both himself and his friends, and him coming to terms with Michael's past actions. Trevor later also befriends the third protagonist, Franklin, becoming somewhat of a mentor figure to him.</p>
